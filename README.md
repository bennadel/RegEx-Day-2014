# Regular Expression Day 2014

by [Ben Nadel][1] (on [Google+][2])

For the 7th annual Regular Expression Day, I wanted to try to come up with something that was a
little bit more fun. For the last few years, the day has snuk up on me, leaving me with little to
show. This year, I wanted to put at least a few days worth of effort into it.
